                <p>As the PROGRAMMER for this assignment, me and my team were tasked with making a prototype 3D platforming game, focusing on a unique movement mechanic, for which we chose to focus on teleporting.</p>
                <p>Below is my Development Process where I believe I made a good platforming, I could definitely have done better knowing my current expertice, but I am still proud of this work!</p>

                    <p>
                        So far, the process in this sprint has felt different than all of my other coding projects to this day, mostly because of the new workflow we've been using. It feels like I'm not just coding the game whenever I have time or whenever I feel like it, but that I actually have a job to get done, deadlines to meet, and work to do. This overall made the project so far feel much more real compared to other previous projects in previous classes like group projects in 180 and 280.
                    </p>
                    <p>The beginning of the sprint was a bit of an adjustment, it was a bit difficult going from just working on things when I had time, to realizing I actually needed to work on it every day, which wasn't a change that happened overnight. Other than this, I didn't really have any other setbacks</p>

                    <p>I got quite a bit done during this sprint, I got the menu, working buttons, working movement, and a built-up interaction system that can be easily implemented into almost any object</p>

                    <p>Sprint kickoff went pretty well, we were all assigned cards aand got to work on them, as mentioned above I had a bit of a slow start, but once I realized my errors I quickly got to work, it was then we realized that we were assigned nearly enough cards, or even had enough in the backlog, this is something we'll make sure to fix next time, in which we'll put in the backlog way more than we think we'll ever need, so as to not have this issue.</p>

                    <p>Moving into this next sprint I am attempting to tackle the inventory system, this will probably take a while as I'll have to teach myself how to do it, but I'm fine with that as it provides a welcome challenge compared to what I got done last sprint which I already kind of knew how to do!</p>
