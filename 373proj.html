                        Sprint 4 has been my most productive sprint yet, this week I managed to get a total of 16 points done total, 13 one point cards and 1 three point card, marking the highest totally I've gotten so far. The goal for this sprint was to get most, if not all, of the rest of the programming for the scene done to leave us plenty of time to texture and put the scene together, as that'll take quite a bit of work, and I'm happy to say that, apart from some cleanup stuff, I've gotten pretty much all the programming done.

                        The card that I worked on this week that is not only the most technical but also the one I had the most trouble with would have to be the Terminal, I took it on myself to not only code the terminal , but also try and make it look as authentic to the game while also getting it to work correctly, I had a whole host of issues while working on this, such as getting the camera to enter in the correct way and reattach to the player, to getting all the unique screens, to moving around the input / typing location, by the time I fully finished it, it really was deserving of the 3 points that the card was given, as, all-in-all, it took me about 10+ hours of work exclusively on the terminal before I finally finished everything it needed to have, and it still doesn't have everything that the Terminal in lethal company has, I could honestly probably dedicate an entire 1-2 week sprint to just fleshing out and adding thing to the Terminal, but sadly we don't have that much time, and I've already created more than what we need for this screen / moon.

                        The thing that was probably the most tedious that I did this sprint was working on adding sound effects to the game, thankfully I found a website that had all of the lethal company SFX on it, ripped straight from the game, however, many of these did not have straightforward names, causing me to sometimes have to manually scroll through the entire 400+ sound file library to find what I need, and then to add it to the code and add delays to make SFX line up with what was need took a lot of time, but everything managed to come out great!
                        All-in-all, I am very proud of the things I've gotten done this sprint, not only with how much I got done but also the specific things I need and how close the programming is to being doing!

                        I got a good amount of things done this sprint, more than last sprint and more similar to our first sprit, I completed 10 cards and 12 points, since one was a 3 point card. I am pretty happy with how much I got done this sprint and I believe keeping this general amount going throughout every sprint is the best for me.
                        The card I had probably the most trouble with during this sprint was probably the ladder, originally I had intended to code a full functioning ladder with animations and upward movement, as well as making it a modular system so you could easily make the ladder as short or tall as needed and it would still work and use the same code, however after hours and hours of work and trying multiple different methods, and encountering bug after bug, I eventually decided to go with Cody's suggestions, swapping to coding it so interacting with the ladder will just teleport you to the bottom / top, I was pretty disappointed in myself for not being able to code this, but I didn't want to take multiple days trying to work on a system that would only be used once or twice, so eventually I decided to go with the final result, learning not to bite off more than I could chew.

                        The thing I coded this sprint that I am the most proud of is probably the quicksand, I got it to blend in decently enough for it to be possible for you to not notice it, but also stick out enough to be visible if you're looking for it, it also slows the player down, drags them down, and makes it very hard to jump, before killing the player once they get low enough, working exactly like the game's quicksand!

                        The most technical thing that I worked on would have to be the scrap adding up, not only does it only do it when you're in the ship, but it gets all the value of that scrap and types the value up to the total very quickly, giving the perfect effect to go along with what it looks like in the game.

                        This sprint I got 12 points and 10 cards finished, 9 one point cards and one 3 point card, adding up to 12 points.

                        Next Sprint I'll be working on the Snare Flea, The Flashlight, implementing all of our new scrap models, settings up the outside section of the planet, and coding the shop ship

                        I got a little bit less than I wanted to done in sprint 2, I only got to 9 points / cards, however some of the things I worked on were more technically complex than last time, however I hope to increase my point count next sprint and try to get back up to around 13 and hopefully even exceed it!</p>

                    <p>The thing I've been having the most trouble with in the day and night system, I've gotten all the code working for the game to keep track of time and having it rotate the directional light to change the sky color, but having the float values of the time match up with the rotational values for the light to give it a smooth mid day to evening to night transition is where I'm having a lot of trouble, although hopefully I'll be able to get that working by next sprint!</p>

                    <p>The most technical thing I did was probably getting the scrap collection area working, so that it detects when you're in the correct area and gives you credit for picking up the items, plus adding the value to your money. Originally we'd planned to cut down by just having it track when you put it in the cabinet, but I realized a way to do the area detection so we decided to go with it!</p>

                    <p>Another part I was very proud of is getting to have different interacts / text pop up for different meshes even if they're in the same blueprint, the way I originally coded the interaction system made that very hard to do so I originally it was a bit difficult to find a workaround, but eventually I did, allowing us to have things like the door console and light switch all be in one ship blueprint instead of a bunch of different ones, making future systems like the ship flying in along easier</p>

                    <p>Next sprint I will most likely finish the day / night cycle, finish ladders, work on new interactions like entering the building, and also probably begin some level design</p>

                    <p>This sprint I was assigned 13 cards and only completed 9 of them, all of them were one point cards so I had the same number of points</p>

                        I've gotten a total of 13 Cards / Points done this sprint, but getting to that point too a lot of work. When I first began work I picked which cards I was assigned were absolutely necessary and easiest to do, this led to more programming the movement and interactions first, then post processing, next moving into dealing with picking up scrap, and then finally to scanning.
                    </p>

                    <p>My 2 biggest problems that I encountered this sprint were probably getting the cabinet to work, and the scanning, the scanning I was having an issue where the For Each Loop wasn't running all of the code in the loop, which turned out to be caused by having a delay node in the wrong part of the loop, causing it to run the next part without finishing the first. The cabinet constantly had variables that were getting missed or that I forgot about that needed to be accounted for, so it took a long while</p>

                    <p>My most technical card completed this sprint is the Post Processing, I had to look up and teach myself a lot of things for that, it involved pixelation, outline shading, and color banding, as well as Custom Stencil Depth in order to color the outlines of specific objects during the scanning feature</p>

                    <p>Next Sprint I'll probably move to working on working ladders, interactable doors, being able to drop scrap outside of the cabinet, and all the interactable features inside of the ship</p>

                    <p>This Sprint I was assigned 15 Cards, I completed 13, have one In Progress, and 1 in assigned
                    Each Card was only 1 point, so the same applies for points</p>
